### Summary
This repo is to document a senior project on creating a plant health tracking system using deep learning. 

### Abstract
Agriculture is such a vital part of our society, and according to the United Nationsâ€™ Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), plant diseases are considered one of the two main causes of decreasing food availability. This paper explores not only the methods and findings of building a CNN disease detection model, but that of building a deployable remote crop disease detection system incorporating IoT technology, a task that has not been published before. By using transfer learning with AlexNet, we were able to predict with 89.8% accuracy tomato plant images into one of the ten pre-defined disease classes. Our proposed system tracks plant health throughout the day by using a microprocessor and a camera to automatically capture images, diagnose the plant, and report results. The system is a proof of concept of a technology that can significantly help increase crop yield, reduce food waste, and automate the tasks of detecting and caring for diseased crops.
