### Summary
This repo is to document a senior project on creating a plant health tracking system using deep learning. 

### Abstract
Agriculture is such a vital part of our society, and crop diseases and bug infestations are the major problems that cause low yield in farms. It is extremely difficult for farmers to detect infections on time, thus there is a need for steady monitoring of vulnerable crops. By using deep learning, we are developing a model that can detect plant health issues through photos, and we are hoping to develop a system that integrates hardware to allow us to track plants real-time using microprocessors and cameras to collect images within certain time intervals. We will be using image processing through CNN (convolutional neural networks). This will help us monitor and track plant health, aiding in the efforts to automate agriculture.
